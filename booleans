Booleans can not only be used in if statements, but can also be used to compare two values outright:

public class EqualNotEqual {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int songsA = 9;
    int songsB = 9;
    int albumLengthA = 41;
    int albumLengthB = 53;
    boolean sameNumberOfSongs = songsA == songsB;
    boolean differentLength = albumLengthA != albumLengthB;

	}
}

A boolean value can also be outputed straight from the print method:

System.out.println(10 == 11);
output: false
