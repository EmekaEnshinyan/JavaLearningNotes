  I am continuinig with codecademy (CA) and have reached the methods section. I have been wondering if an efficient step to take that would (hopefully) maximize my progress and 
  get my portfolio hire-ready is to learn Spring and make a small application in tandem to working through CA and mastering the fundamentals of java.
  
  What is the difference between Maven and Gradle projects? 
  
  I have found that intelliji requires the premium edition in order to use spring tools. So I switched to vs code. 
  
  Spring has successfully been set up on vs code.

  Upon further analysis of some code, I still don't feel I have a strong understanding of the dot operator when working with methods. Review required.
  from java in a nutshell pg 49: :An object is a collection of data and methods that operate on that data; the data
fields and methods of an object are called its members. The dot (.) operator
accesses these members. If o is an expression that evaluates to an object reference
(or a class name), and f is the name of a field of the class, o.f evaluates to
the value contained in that field. If m is the name of a method, o.m refers to that
method and allows it to be invoked using the () operator shown later."
  visual: OBJECT ----- data "we work for OBJECT"                          OBJECT wants to evaluate data so OBJECT.data
                    \                                                     OBJECT wants to call method so OBJECT.method
                     \ methods "we talk with data and work for OBJECT"  |  
   
   I need to review the nature of constructors.
   
   4:33pm
   Do not clearly understand the process and syntax reassigning instance fields within methods. is it merely using var reassignment with = operator?

  Codecademt is foing very well. it feels like I'm being strongly challenged and learning the Java language.
  I was also recommended a new projects by Buy Mentor Janelle Cahill Queen courage me to create a news feed provider 
  from the website Hacker News using Java and swing.
  as of now I feel that I should complete the code academy course so I can Master the fundamentals of the Java language 
  before I engage in the project. however it might be beneficial to just get started on it and learn as I go.
  another update is my friend works for Salesforce now and is encouraging me to finish some Trailhead Salesforce courses 
  so that she can work on getting me a job as a developer. I need to make sure I fit this in my other work as she will 
  have to touch base with me on the 15th of this month

  I am still working through salesforce modules in preparation for a possible interview at around April 15th. 
  I've noticed that I have not made many contributions in the past week, most of it due to my salesforce studying. One 
strategy is to continue to work on coding challenges from HackerRank and post them on my git.

  I have been extremely sick for the past two weeks and I had a death in the family. These events have impeded my progress.
  I will soon be working on my spring application and studying for the Salesforce interview.

  Have an interview opportunity with Otus, which is very exciting. Family issues have been taken care of and I can now 
  focus on my work.

   After the designing the basics of the API, I decided to move on to hackerank and work on coding challenges for interview prep. However I'm noticing that there are some things that I need to review such as
S inheritance and constructors. I was first looking at the stream class regarding buffered streams and then I moved on to lambda expressions which I know I need to understand I know it's a core part of understanding Java however since there's that Gap in my knowledge regarding inheritance and constructors I decided to go back to those.
I'm also going to begin prepping for the Salesforce interview and tailoring my resume to maximize my chances since I will be applying this week and using my friend's reference who works within Salesforce and is in very high rank with the company

   I'm going to begin applying for Salesforce positions, specifically in platform development positions using my friends referral.

   I need to engage in a combination of tasks: my project in angular, and the coding challenges. Without studying more of the fundamentals of Java, I think focusing on those two tasks will be sufficient to make me more marketable.

  Now working with the plan of applying to at least 1 job every day. My focus is going to be on full stack-related positions.

  I have been rarely active on my github for the past three weeks for two reasons: 1) I've been preparing, via HackerRank challenges, for an assessment from a Salesforce position. 2) I just bought Introduction to Algorithms and will be reading that book inbetween my work on coding challenges.
  At some point soon, I should consider going back to my fullstack project.

  I have not heard back from the job. I think it's safe to say that that road has now closed off. I have devised a plan for study priority. It is located in my silver notebook. I need to make sure to include Angular book and hackerrank tutorial so that I can complete my turing freelance profile.

  I am currently sending many emails to contacts I made during a convention I was guarding during my job. Soon after, I will continue my js learning, angular and my api

  After speaking with a mentor about my current progress and knowledge, I found that there is much more that I need to learn. I have decidede to follow two developer roadmaps (see 2021 Java Developer RoadMap.png and backend_roadmap.png) Thus I am now focusing on stilll keeping 
  my eye on possible jobs, but for now, I am going to begin learning about the many facets of the 3internet (DNS, Domains, HTTPS< SSL, Hosting, etc.)

    After speaking with friends and others who have a long history in the field of fulstack engineering, I realized that I STILL hacve gaps in my knowledge on the fundamentals of Java. 
    For that reason, I have been rarely active on my GitHub and have been instead making a note/study Google Docs page with a tbale of contents.

    I have also decided to try to engage in two projects: the first being the ahckernews API, and the second being a rudimentary translator that has a basic frontend UI and a backend that will manipulate the data. 
    I am thinking of have an "approximation algorithm" where if a word is typed in incorrectly, a dropdown menu will come up show possible words/phrases. Inspiration will be taken from Goole Trnslate and Jisho.org

  It has been difficult as of late to focus on my programming and my API project. Family issues have been getting increasingly complicated. Not to mention that my catalytic converter from my Prius was stolen not 
  long ago and I had to pay a exorbitant amount of money in order to get it replaced and protected so that I couldn't be stolen again. When things calm down I look forward to continuing my API design and also 
  finding the appropriate algorithm to solve two coding problems that was presented to me during a job interview and the other one presented to me by a long time dear friend of mine who has been in the field of 
  software development for over 20 years
