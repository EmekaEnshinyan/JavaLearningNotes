  I am continuinig with codecademy (CA) and have reached the methods section. I have been wondering if an efficient step to take that would (hopefully) maximize my progress and 
  get my portfolio hire-ready is to learn Spring and make a small application in tandem to working through CA and mastering the fundamentals of java.
  
  What is the difference between Maven and Gradle projects? 
  
  I have found that intelliji requires the premium edition in order to use spring tools. So I switched to vs code. 
  
  Spring has successfully been set up on vs code.

  Upon further analysis of some code, I still don't feel I have a strong understanding of the dot operator when working with methods. Review required.
  from java in a nutshell pg 49: :An object is a collection of data and methods that operate on that data; the data
fields and methods of an object are called its members. The dot (.) operator
accesses these members. If o is an expression that evaluates to an object reference
(or a class name), and f is the name of a field of the class, o.f evaluates to
the value contained in that field. If m is the name of a method, o.m refers to that
method and allows it to be invoked using the () operator shown later."
  visual: OBJECT ----- data "we work for OBJECT"                          OBJECT wants to evaluate data so OBJECT.data
                    \                                                     OBJECT wants to call method so OBJECT.method
                     \ methods "we talk with data and work for OBJECT"  |  
   
   I need to review the nature of constructors.

   Do not clearly understand the process and syntax reassigning instance fields within methods. is it merely using var reassignment with = operator?

  Codecademt is foing very well. it feels like I'm being strongly challenged and learning the Java language.
  I was also recommended a new projects by Buy Mentor Janelle Cahill Queen courage me to create a news feed provider 
  from the website Hacker News using Java and swing.
  as of now I feel that I should complete the code academy course so I can Master the fundamentals of the Java language 
  before I engage in the project. however it might be beneficial to just get started on it and learn as I go.
  another update is my friend works for Salesforce now and is encouraging me to finish some Trailhead Salesforce courses 
  so that she can work on getting me a job as a developer. I need to make sure I fit this in my other work as she will 
  have to touch base with me on the 15th of this month

  I am still working through salesforce modules in preparation for a possible interview at around April 15th. 
  I've noticed that I have not made many contributions in the past week, most of it due to my salesforce studying. One 
strategy is to continue to work on coding challenges from HackerRank and post them on my git.

  I have been extremely sick for the past two weeks and I had a death in the family. These events have impeded my progress.
  I will soon be working on my spring application and studying for the Salesforce interview.

   After the designing the basics of the API, I decided to move on to hackerank and work on coding challenges for interview prep. However I'm noticing that there are some things that I need to review such as
S inheritance and constructors. I was first looking at the stream class regarding buffered streams and then I moved on to lambda expressions which I know I need to understand I know it's a core part of understanding Java however since there's that Gap in my knowledge regarding inheritance and constructors I decided to go back to those.
I'm also going to begin prepping for the Salesforce interview and tailoring my resume to maximize my chances since I will be applying this week and using my friend's reference who works within Salesforce and is in very high rank with the company

   I need to engage in a combination of tasks: my project in angular, and the coding challenges. Without studying more of the fundamentals of Java, I think focusing on those two tasks will be sufficient to make me more marketable.
