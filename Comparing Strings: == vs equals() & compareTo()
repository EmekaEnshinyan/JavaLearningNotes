*Using "==" is a poor way to compare strings as each string refers to a unique object, each of which is allocated to memory

*Better method is to use equals()
  ex: String fruit = in.nextLine();
      if )fruit.equals("yes")){
      ...
      }

*compareTo() can check which string compoes first in the alphabet (for example)
