*Creating an Array
  ex: int[] x;
      String[] y;
      
      x = new int[5]
      y = new String[car]

*Can create a separated sequencde of elements enclosed in braces
  ex: int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
      
*Accessing an array
  common way to access arrays is through iteration using tools such
  as for and while loops. This is also called TRAVERSING an array.
  ex: 
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 4){
    System.out.print(a[i]);
    i++
    }
