--DEF--
Blocks of code that can be called from another part of the program
  can have parameters that allow passing of data
  can return info to the part of program that called them
  methods end as soon as they reach a return statement
  
--VOID--
return is not required unless a return type in parameters is required to be passed.
Otherwise the desired return value is placed after static

Ex:
public static double divide(int a result){
  b = 4;
  a = 2;
  result = b/a;
  System.out.print(result);
}

public class Newsfeed {

  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
  //can initialize array as the modifier
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    //the return value will correspond to what is in the body of the method
    return topics;
  }
  // Create getTopics() below:
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    
  }
}
