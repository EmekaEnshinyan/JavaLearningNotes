The signiture of a method is just like the structure of variable declaration:

declare var - [type] [var];/ [type] [var] = [value];

method signiture - [modifier] [?] [type] [name](parameter)

A method is a callable piece of code that you pass input to and either does something with the input, or return a value that typically is the result of doing something with that input. A method is defined with four required parts and one optional:
optional static modifier
required an access modifier - either public, private, protected, or it can be left blank, which is still a modifier, and is called default
required return type - must be included. Use void if the method does not return anything
requiredmethod name - follows Javas standard naming rules
requiredmethod parameters - inside the parentheses, what is passed to the method from the calling code

public static int min(int a, int b) {

access modifier - public
static - included
return type - int
method name - min
method parameters - (int, int) with variable names a and b
