there's a discrepency between what I'm learning in Java and what I'm learning in Android Studio. Some of the code requires imports that I am completely unfamiliar with even though
it is recommended to learn about the main libraries of Java. I simply do not want to continue to import libraries of which I have no idea how they work.
